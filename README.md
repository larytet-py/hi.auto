Live coding in Python. Our goal is to test for fluency, control, speed and sharpness. We prefer to do this step initially to save time for both you and us in case it's not a good fit. Our exercise takes 50 minutes to complete and involves writing a small micro service using a web framework of your choice (but not Django). Our goal is not to test the knowledge in a specific web framework. If you're not fluent in writing a small web service we suggest you brush up on this.
